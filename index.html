        <h1> Chess, also known as international chess[1], is a tactical board game played by two players
           internationally. It is currently one of the most popular games in the world. Players are equipped 
           with six types of chess pieces at the beginning of the game, a total of 16 pieces, namely the King,
            Queen, Rook (also known as Castle), Bishop (also known as Bishop[2]), Knight (also known as Knight) and Pawn. Players are divided into two major formations, the first to play white and the second to play  black. The goal of the game is to checkmate the opponent's king, that is, to make the opponent's king enter the attack range of one's own chess pieces and the opponent cannot resolve it. If the player has blocked the king and the remaining chess pieces before checking the opponent (not being in check, but the king has no way to move in the next step), the game will be judged as a draw.</h1>

    <h1> Rule</h1>
  <div class='container' id='flexend'>
  <h1>Basic Rules:

A player's pieces cannot occupy the positions of their own pieces.

If a piece moves to occupy an enemy piece, the latter piece is removed from the board and replaced by the piece that moved. The removed piece is said to be captured.

Except for the knight, no piece can pass over another piece.

A player cannot put their king in a checkmate position.</h2>

    <h1>King: The most important piece in the entire chess game, it cannot be captured. It can move horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, but can only move one square at a time. The position it moves to cannot be threatened by an opponent's piece. Capturing pieces is the same as moving.</h1>
